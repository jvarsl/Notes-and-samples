React - SPA (single page app) for UI, mixture of JS and HTML to make JSX.
In div with elemendId "root" we render our App.js.
React consists from components, they're created as JS functions:
 function App() { return (<> JSX type text </>); }

States are immutable in React (means it cannot change, new one is created and placed instead)
  import {useState} from 'react'
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([{text:'test', id:1}]);
  to add new tasks: setTasks([...tasks, {text:'test2', id:2})

To use APIs from different sources CORS have to be enabled on the server for the front end.
  ASP.NET: Nugget Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors
  API Controller: class marked as [EnableCors("*","*","*")] to allow from all sources
  In WepApi config add - config.EnableCors();

From C# to return json acceptable capitalization use Newonsoft
        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "id")]
        public int Id { get; set; }
